          <p class="muted">
            At <strong>Wave Crypto Insights</strong>, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.
            This policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard data when you visit our website.
          </p>

          <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            In most cases, Wave Crypto Insights does not collect personally identifiable information.
            However, in certain cases (such as newsletter subscriptions, contact forms, or feedback submissions),
            we may ask for your email address or name. This information is collected only with your consent
            and used solely for the intended purpose — such as sending newsletters or replying to inquiries.
            We do not sell or share your information with third parties.
          </p>

          <h3>Cookies and Non-Personal Data</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            We may use cookies to enhance your experience on our site. Cookies are small text files stored
            on your device that help remember your preferences and improve site performance.
            You can disable cookies in your browser settings at any time. Disabling cookies may affect
            some site functionality but will not prevent you from browsing our content.
          </p>
          <p class="muted">
            Our servers may automatically log non-personal data such as your IP address, browser type,
            operating system, referring URLs, and general site usage. This information helps us improve
            performance, detect issues, and understand visitor trends. It is not used to personally identify users.
          </p>

          <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            Our website may contain links to third-party platforms (such as analytics tools, ad networks,
            or external articles). These sites have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible
            for their content or data practices. We recommend reviewing their policies before interacting
            with those services.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Security</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            We take reasonable technical measures to protect your information against unauthorized access,
            alteration, or destruction. However, no online platform can guarantee 100% security.
            You share information at your own discretion and risk.
          </p>

          <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in our practices
            or for legal and compliance reasons. Updates will be reflected on this page with a revised date.
          </p>

          <h3>Contact</h3>
          <p class="muted">
            If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or how we handle your data,
            please reach out via our <a href="../contact/contact.html">Contact page</a>.
